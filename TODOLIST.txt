TODO:
Village:
	-Add mountains in background
	-Villager sprites
	-Villager dialog boxes
	-Dialog box SFX
	-Gold spending system
	-Fix cave layering

Player:
	-Player Jump
	-Player Ability 1,2, and 4
	-Add paper flip
	
AI:
	-Dogs should circle player and randomly charge in
	-AI should have mob mentality, if a mob sees the player nearby mobs of the same type should be attracted to the player too
	-Fix Archer Arrows
	-Knockback (this shouldn't be difficult since we are using unity's physics engine) *important so sprites don't overlap*
	-Shadow Knight AI (he should have the same abilities as the player) *classic Zelda ripoff*
	
Terrain:
	-Terrain player can jump on (small hills or small cliffs)
	-Hole leading to lower more difficult floor (new scene)
	-doors leading to other rooms (the easiest way to handle the rooms would be to load a new scene)

MISC:
	-Delete clone objects (arrows, damage text, etc) *Use the destroy command*
	-stop ability3 animation from running at start *no idea how to fix that*
	-Save player stats and items after loading new scene *easy, I'll just google it*
	-Fade out after scenes *we already have the script, it's attached to the fade panel on the main camera*
