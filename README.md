# Doodle Warriors
Doodle Warriors is a Rogue/RPG style Indie game in developement by @LukeWeaver & @RonySingh

# How does it work?
Doodle Warriors utilizes Unity's physics engine and GameObjects API to allow complex interactions between the player, their enviroment, and enemies. Save files are saved in the registry to save progress.

# Who is it for?
Anyone who likes randomly generated enemies and terrain should play this game! (Inspired by Paper Mario and Castle Crashers)

# Where can I get it?
Some day when I have more time, I will finish developement and publish the game onto Steam.
